<p>Arpita just implemented <a href="/ftd/~/127/"><code>message-host</code> event handler</a> support. Now
the “ftd host” (we will rename <code>ftd::Library</code> to <code>ftd::Host</code> terminology soon), can
define a JavaScript function (and in future when we support iOS etc, register Swift
function etc) and call it as event handler from FTD documents:</p>

<p>Was writing a CR about <a href="https://www.fifthtry.com/fpm/~/24/">“fpm actions”</a>, and my
initial thought was to expose form errors using special variables, but then I
realised we do not have a mechanism to register for changes in <a href="/ftd/~/121/">special
variables</a>.</p>
<p>Variable change can only happen on client (it can still be triggered by server
and sent to client, eg on WebSocket). We are going to have <code>fpm.js</code> file to handle
those variables. We already have methods in <code>ftd.js</code> to update any variable, and
already have variable dependency tracker that updates the rendered DOM tree in an
efficient way.</p>

exposes all the variables? Wouldn’t computing that document be expensive? What if
we do not even use them?</p>
<p>One simple answer is to not have a single virtual document, but have a bunch of
document, maybe even one document per variable in extreme case. So we only import
the document that we want to use.</p>
<p>We will also have a linter that will complain if a document is imported but not
used, (and therefore we have <a href="///ftd.dev/~/44/"><code>import: foo as _</code></a> syntax).</p>

Host. We have the <code>.get()</code> method, and FPM is putting a lot of interesting logic
in it, so this part of design is proving fruitful. Then we need special documents
for “generated” variables, and ftd host will take care of updating them on client
if needed.</p>
<p>FPM also exposes processors, and that’s also working out quite well, there are very
FPM specific processors.</p>
<p>This does mean there is issue with portability of FTD documents between different
“FTD Hosts”, would we have more than one hosts of FPM would be the only host?</p>
<p>We have at least one contender for next FTD host: arbit pages. If you want to use
ftd to power say your homepage (without using <code>fpm-repo</code>), and you must consider,
you are going to need your own variables with your own way of fetching documents
and your own</p>

wanted a <code>ftd.row</code>, but the component derived from a <code>ftd.row</code> is no longer
<code>row-like</code>? Why do I want a row specifically? It kind of does not make sense? Maybe
I want a container, in which case I may be adding children to that container, which
means I have to have generic types like <code>ftd.element</code>, which accepts any ui element,
or <code>ftd.container</code>, which accepts a container.</p>
<p>What about <code>ftd.image</code>? What if I want to say give me an image. I can pass any
instance ftd.image or instance of a component created directly or indirectly from
ftd.image. But what about a row that wraps an image? Should that row not be
accepted by a component that is expecting image? Why would any component want to
accept an image specifically?</p>

FTD has been under a lot of development
and its good for us to record our daily development.</p>
<p>We have been keeping a personal journal in FifthTry internal documentation, but
it would be better if it moved all FTD related things here for everyone’s benefit.</p>
<p>We kind of believe in writing down our thoughts during all meetings as much as we
can, etc, a lot of stuff we write in change requests, linked from the Roadmap page.
But since they are all scattered across different CRs, its not easy to keep up
with what is going on with the project, so we kind of want to duplicate or link
here what is going on.</p>
<p>We also want to create a loom recording after the fact, just to capture a few more
things we might have missed when writing it down.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><code>--- ftd.text: Hello 👋</code> and <code>--- ftd.text: World 🌎</code> are two external children
of component <code>foo</code> and <code>foo</code> is open at <code>--- ftd.row:</code>. Earlier we used to wrap all
the external children in a column component (Why not row? no good reason just that
column is used a lot) and then attach this wrapper component to the desired place.
So this created a problem here. Instead of children appearing in a row-wise fashion,
it appears column-wise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also, open container <code>ftd.row</code> has <code>spacing: 20</code> which means all its children would
contain spacing from each other, except the first visible one, but here it has only
one wrapper child, so no spacing.</p>

or removed and so what about spacing then?</p>
<p>As we know there should be no space for the first element, so now that the first
child has vanished, the second child should act as the first one and space
should be removed. (And obviously, when the first child becomes visible again,
the second one should restore the spacing.)</p>
<p>Here’s the solution. We have added a new attribute (<code>data-spacing</code>) in the
parent node that contains the spacing value. Every time this kind of event occurs,
we reevaluate spacing for its children.</p>
